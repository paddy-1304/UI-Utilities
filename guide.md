Once you have done this, go back to RoutineHub and press 'Get Shortcut'. Once it has redirected you to the Shortcuts app and the UI Utilities Shortcut has appeared, scroll all the way down through the code and select **Add Untrusted Shortcut**. None of your data is stored and it is completely safe.

UI Utilities requires iOS 13 and above. If you are on iOS 12, you can download version 4 or belowfr om the **[RoutineHub Versions](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1421)**. Once you have it, press on the three dots in the top right of the shortcut and scroll down a bit to the Dictionary. Change the Version from 'x' to 99 or above. This will mean you do not have to update the Shortcut.

### First Use

When you first run the shortcut or any function that requires access to something, an alert will appear asking you to allow acces to a part of your device of a webpage. For the Shortcut to function properly, please allow all of these when promted. If you wish, you can not allow acces to your camera for the photos but the access to websites must be enabled to check for updates and to show this guide.

### Troubleshooting

If any bug or error occurs, restart your device. If it continues to occur, delete and reinstall the shortcut. Check that you are on the latest version. **Please report all bugs to utilitiesconcerns@gmail.com**
